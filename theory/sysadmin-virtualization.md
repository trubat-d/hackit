# Sysadmin, Virtualization

### Role:

* Keeps systems updated
* Manages servers and VMs
* Test performances
* Manages databases and backups

### Virtualization

> _“Principle of creating a virtual environment inside of a physical(or another virtual) environment.This allows resources to be used more efficiently by simulating multiple environments on a single physical system.”_

Pros:

* It saves money, simplifies management, make those environment isolated and permit backup and recovery.

Cons:

* Compromise performances, more complexity and bigger risk of host failing.

### Container

> _“Separates applications in individual and independent boxes that are pre-configured”_

### Hypervisor

> _“Software called hypervisors create and help managing virtual Machines (VMs) generating a GUEST machine running on a HOST one”_

* Type 1 is operating on hardware (bare metal) to manage hardware and VMs
* Type 2 also known as VMM (Virtual Machine Monitor) operates as an application program for running OSs

### Cloud Computing

> _"Cloud computing is using internet-based computer services instead of local hardware and software."_

Divided in multiple categories:

* Software as a Service (SaaS): on-demand Apps (Zoom, Discord, Slack, Spotify)
* Platform as a Service (PaaS): development frameworks, OSs, VMs, control structures
* Infrastructure as a Service(IaaS): Delivers compute, network and storage resources over internet as pay-as-you-go services (AWS, GCE, Microsoft Azure)

## Troubleshooting

### Server

* Service Control: manages all services (stop,start,restart) and Identify and resolve service issues
* Log Analysis: review logs for errors and messages
* System Monitoring: monitor all system errors and critical messages and check for sufficient disk space
* Additional Management Tasks: add/delete Users and manages file systems/devices/processes
