# TCP/IP Model

The TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) model is a simplified version of the OSI model, consisting of four layers:

1. Application Layer: Combines the functionalities of OSI's Application, Presentation, and Session layers.
2. Transport Layer: Equivalent to the OSI Transport layer, using TCP and UDP protocols.
3. Internet Layer: Corresponds to the OSI Network layer, handling IP addressing and routing.
4. Network Access Layer: Combines the functions of OSI's Data Link and Physical layers.

### TCP Handshake

* Consists of 3 steps SYN, SYN/ACK, ACK sent alternatively between the sender and the receiver to ensure the connection to have to ability to send packets afterward ensuring the consistency
