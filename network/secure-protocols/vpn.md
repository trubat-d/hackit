# VPN

> _“Allows devices on separate networks to communicate securely using a dedicated path over internet (tunnel) forming a private network”_

* Benefits of VPN
  * Enhanced security: Encrypts data to protect it from potential eavesdroppers
  * Privacy: Masks your IP address and online activity from third parties
  * Access to geo-restricted content: Allows bypassing geographical restrictions on websites and services
  * Remote access: Enables secure connection to a private network from remote locations
  * Improved performance: Can potentially provide faster speeds for certain online activities
  * Cost-effective for businesses: Reduces the need for expensive long-distance leased lines

  *   IPSec (Internet Protocol Security)

      Think of IPSec as a secure envelope for your internet data. It wraps your information in a protective layer, making sure it's safe from prying eyes as it travels across the internet. It's like sending a confidential letter in a tamper-proof package.
  *   PPP (Point-to-Point Protocol)

      PPP is like a direct phone line between two computers. It creates a straightforward, one-on-one connection, allowing them to communicate directly without any middlemen. It's simple but effective for connecting two points securely.
  *   PPTP (Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol)

      PPTP is an older method of creating a secure tunnel for your data. While it's not as secure as newer methods, it's still used in some older systems. Think of it as an early model of a secure data pipeline - it works, but newer models offer better protection.
