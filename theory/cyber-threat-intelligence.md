# Cyber Threat Intelligence

**Data:** Discrete indicators associated with an adversary, such as IP addresses, URLs or hashes.

**Information:** A combination of multiple data points that answer questions such as “How many times have employees accessed example.com within the month?”

**Intelligence:** The correlation of data and information to extract patterns of actions based on contextual analysis.



threat intelligence cam be gathered from different sources under the following categories:

* **Internal:**
  * Corporate security events such as vulnerability assessments and incident response reports.
  * Cyber awareness training reports.
  * System logs and events.
* **Community:**
  * Open web forums.
  * Dark web communities for cybercriminals.
*   **External**

    * Threat intel feeds (Commercial & Open-source)
    * Online marketplaces.
    * Public sources include government data, publications, social media, financial and industrial assessments.


* **Strategic Intel:** High-level intel that looks into the organisation’s threat landscape and maps out the risk areas based on trends, patterns and emerging threats that may impact business decisions.
* **Technical Intel:** Looks into evidence and artefacts of attack used by an adversary. Incident Response teams can use this intel to create a baseline attack surface to analyse and develop defence mechanisms.
* **Tactical Intel:** Assesses adversaries’ tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). This intel can strengthen security controls and address vulnerabilities through real-time investigations.
* **Operational Intel:** Looks into an adversary’s specific motives and intent to perform an attack. Security teams may use this intel to understand the critical assets available in the organisation (people, processes and technologies) that may be targeted.



### Lifecycle

* Direction -> Collection -> Processing -> Analysis -> Dissemination -> Feedback
