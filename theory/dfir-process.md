### DFIR: Intro

* Digital Forensics - Search of digital evidences inside of the flow of information that we have
* Use of Forensics to identify activity of interest from a security perspective
  1. **Preparation**: Before an incident occurs, ensure readiness by establishing necessary people, processes, and technology for prevention and response.
  2. **Identification**: Detect incidents through indicators. Analyze these for false positives, document findings, and communicate with relevant stakeholders.
  3. **Containment**: Limit the incident's impact. Implement short-term and long-term solutions based on forensic analysis.
  4. **Eradication**: Remove the threat from the network after thorough forensic analysis and effective containment. Ensure all entry points are secured to prevent reoccurrence.
  5. **Recovery**: Restore disrupted services to their pre-incident state.
  6. **Lessons Learned**: Review and document the incident. Implement improvements based on findings to enhance future incident preparedness.
