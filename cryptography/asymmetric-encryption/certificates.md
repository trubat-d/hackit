# Certificates

* If I encrypt a document with my private key, people with my public key can decrypt it and be assured that it came from me.

Browsers come with specific Certificate Authority that have specific trusted Signatures

They make the browser able to tell if content from a page is comming from a trusted authority or not



For a free certificate you can use "Let's Encrypt"
