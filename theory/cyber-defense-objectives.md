# Cyber defense objectives

### Prevention

* Block Malicious Threats
* Secure Endpoints, Networks and Servers
* Maintain Secure and Compliant Configurations

Based on Security Policies, Employees awareness and Access Control

### Detection

* Identify anomalous behavior
* Detect compromises
* Discover data leaks and potential Breaches

Tools Like IDS (Intrusion Detection Systems) and SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) can be based on Signatures (ex: hash and checksums) or Anomaly in behavior

### Response

*   Have a Plan

    Develop a comprehensive incident response plan that outlines roles, responsibilities, and procedures. Example: Creating a step-by-step guide for handling a data breach, including who to notify and how to contain the incident.
*   Assess Events

    Evaluate potential security incidents to determine their severity and impact. Example: Analyzing unusual network traffic patterns to determine if they indicate a potential cyber attack.
*   Escalate Incidents

    Properly communicate and elevate serious security issues to appropriate personnel or teams. Example: Notifying the CISO (Chief information Security Officer) immediately upon detection of a ransomware attack.
*   Manage

    Coordinate and oversee the response efforts to ensure efficient handling of incidents. Example: Assigning tasks to different team members during a DDoS attack, such as traffic filtering and stakeholder communication.
*   Report

    Document and communicate incident details, actions taken, and lessons learned. Example: Creating a post-incident report detailing how a phishing attack was identified, contained, and what preventive measures will be implemented.

*   Preparation

    The preparation phase involves setting up the necessary resources, processes, and training to effectively respond to potential security incidents. This includes:

    * Developing incident response plans
    * Establishing a dedicated incident response team
    * Conducting regular security drills and tabletop exercises
    * Creating and maintaining an up-to-date contact list for key personnel
    * Ensuring necessary tools and technologies are in place

    Example: A company conducts monthly cybersecurity workshops for employees and maintains an updated incident response playbook accessible to all team members.
*   Detection and Analysis

    This phase focuses on identifying potential security incidents and determining their scope and impact. Key activities include:

    * Monitoring systems and networks for anomalies
    * Analyzing alerts and logs to identify potential threats
    * Determining the type and severity of an incident
    * Documenting findings and initial assessment

    Example: An organization's security operations center detects unusual outbound traffic from a server. They analyze the traffic patterns and system logs to determine if it's a potential data exfiltration attempt.
*   Containment, Eradication, and Recovery

    This phase involves stopping the incident from spreading, removing the threat, and restoring affected systems. Key steps include:

    * Isolating affected systems to prevent further damage
    * Removing malware or other malicious elements
    * Patching vulnerabilities that were exploited
    * Restoring systems from clean backups
    * Verifying system integrity and functionality

    Example: After detecting a ransomware infection, the IT team immediately disconnects the affected computers from the network, removes the malware using specialized tools, and restores data from recent backups.
*   Post-Incident Activity

    This final phase focuses on learning from the incident and improving future responses. Activities include:

    * Conducting a thorough post-mortem analysis
    * Documenting lessons learned
    * Updating incident response plans and security policies
    * Implementing additional security measures as needed
    * Providing additional training based on incident insights

    Example: Following a successful phishing attack, the security team conducts a lessons-learned meeting, updates the company's email security policies, and organizes an company-wide training session on recognizing and reporting phishing attempts.
